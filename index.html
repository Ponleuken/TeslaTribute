          <li>
            <span id="invention">1880s - Alternating Current (AC) Electricity System: </span>
            <p>Tesla's work on AC electricity helped to revolutionize the way we power our homes and businesses. AC is more efficient than direct current (DC) for long-distance transmission, which is why it is the standard today.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span id="invention">1887 - AC Motor: </span>
            <p>Tesla's work on AC electricity helped to revolutionize the way we power our homes and businesses. AC is more efficient than direct current (DC) for long-distance transmission, which is why it is the standard today.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span id="invention">1891 - Tesla Coil: </span>
            <p>The Tesla coil is a high-voltage, low-current transformer that can produce electrical sparks. Tesla developed the coil to transmit electricity wirelessly, but it is now most commonly used in science education and entertainment.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span id="invention">1890s - Radio: </span>
            <p>Although Guglielmo Marconi is often credited with inventing the radio, Tesla also made significant contributions to the development of radio technology. He received a patent for a radio transmitter in 1893, and his work on radio waves helped to lay the foundation for modern radio broadcasting.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span id="invention">1891 - Fluorescent Lamp: </span>
            <p>Tesla is credited with developing the first fluorescent lamp, which uses electricity to excite mercury vapor, which then produces ultraviolet light that is converted to visible light by a phosphor coating. Fluorescent lamps are now widely used in homes and businesses because they are more energy-efficient than incandescent lamps.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span id="invention">1898 - Remote Control: </span>
            <p>Tesla developed a remote-controlled boat in 1898, which he demonstrated at an electrical exhibition in New York City. This was one of the first demonstrations of remote control technology.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span id="invention">Early 1900s - Wireless Transmission of Energy: </span>
            <p>Tesla was a visionary who believed that it would be possible to transmit electrical energy wirelessly over long distances. He conducted a number of experiments on wireless transmission of power, but he was never able to develop a commercially viable system.</p>
